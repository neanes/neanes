# Web App

You can try Neanes in your browser [here](https://danielgarthur.github.io/neanes-web-app/).

The web version has less features than the desktop version and may have bugs not present in the desktop version. It requires a Chromium-based browser, such as Chrome or Edge.

## Notes

- Mobile is not currently supported.
- To print, use your browser's standard print functionality.
- To export to PDF, use your browser's standard print-to-PDF functionality.
- The app will attempt to save your work inside your browser's local storage, which is persisted even if the tab or browser is closed. However, to ensure that you do not lose you work, it is best to use the save feature, which will allow you to download the file to your computer.
